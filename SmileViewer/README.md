The bulk of this code should be somewhat self explainatory. 

Running setup.sh should create the needed virtual environment 
    npm test should almost verify everything is working OR
From there npm start should run both the front end and back end
the GUI is hopefully straight forward. 

you can view the app at localhost:3000 and there are some debug endpoints at localhost:8000 

The app does take a while to build at first, so give 10 - 15 seconds. 
thanks
